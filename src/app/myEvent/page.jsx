            DESCRIPTION OF EVENT: Trip to the south part of spain where I will
            celebrate my 30th birthday by sharing my experience in Spain with
            you all. We will be located on the beach in southwester florida.
            Looking at a timeline for about a week and possible extensions if
            you would like to explore other parts of Spain.
            <br />
            Morrocco could also be a possability. There is a fairy that can take
            us for the day.
            <br />I will attempt to provide free housing, but depending on the
            amount of people that are interested, I may need to charge for
            housing.
